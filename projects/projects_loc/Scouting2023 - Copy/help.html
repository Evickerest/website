    <h1>Instructions:</h1>
    <h2>Step One:</h2>
    <p>First select the "Info" tab.</p>
    <p>Then, type in your name to "Scouter Name", the current match number into "Match #" and the robot team number you are scouting into "Team #". </p>
    <p>If at any point the robot breaks, and cannot compete during the match in any meaningful way, you can select "robot  broke".</p>
    <h2>Step Two:</h2>
    <p>Second, select the "Auto" tab.</p>
    <p>Then, select what the robot does in auto.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Engaged: The robot is balanced and all other robots contacting the charge station are docked</li>
        <li>Docked: The robot is contacting the charge station.</li>
        <li>None: If the robot does not do anything, select "none".</li>
        <li>Mobility: The robot leaves their community during auto.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: It is possible to be engaged with the charge station but not get mobility points during auto.</p>
    <p>Then, select the points scored during auto.</p>
    <p>If the robot scores a game piece, press the "+" button in the "Hits" column on either High, Mid, or Low depending on where it was scored.</p>
    <p>If the robot attempts to score a game piece and fails, press the "+" button in the "Misses" column on either High, Mid, or Low depending on where it was attempted.</p>
    <p>If at any point the "+" button was incorrectly pressed, you can press the "-" button to take away 1 from the value.</p>
    <h2>Step Three:</h2>
    <p>Third, select the "Teleop" tab.</p>
    <p>This section is identical to what was in auto.</p>
    <h2>Step Four:</h2>
    <p>Lastly, select the "Endgame" tab.</p>
    <p>Select what the robot does in the endgame.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Engaged: The robot is balanced and all other robots contacting the charge station are docked</li>
        <li>Docked: The robot is contacting the charge station.</li>
        <li>Parked: The robot ends in their community at the end of teleop.</li>
        <li>None: If the robot does not do anything, select "none".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: If a robot is docked or engaged, that is not considered parked. </p>
    <p>Then, select what happens on the charge station.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Double Engaged: If two robots dock and engage with the charge station.</li>
        <li>Triple Engaged: If three robots dock and engage with the charge station.</li>
        <li>Attempted Double/Triple: If two or three robots try to enagage and fail.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then, give a rating to the following descriptions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cycle Speed: This represents how fast the robot can pick up a piece, score it, and go get another piece.</li>
        <li>Maneuverability: This represents how well the robot can traverse the field, including how well they can dodge other robots.</li>
        <li>Defensive Ability: This represents how well a robot can play defense. If the robot did not play defense, leave this rating blank.</li>
        <li>Overall Rating: This represents how well the scouter thinks the robot did in comparision to other robots.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then, write in any comments. These are for other points that the scouter finds important.</p>
    <h2>Step Five:</h2>
    <p>Press submit!!!</p>
    <p>If pressing submit does not work, it may mean that not everything was filled out. Certain fields are required to be filled out in order to submit. However, this is not the case if you select the "robot broke" checkbox.</p>
    <p>If all goes well, it will says "Submission Succesful!"</p>
